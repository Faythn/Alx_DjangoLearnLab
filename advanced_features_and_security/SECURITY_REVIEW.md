# Security Review

### Implemented Measures
1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` ensures all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
   - HSTS (`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`) locks browsers into HTTPS mode.

2. **Secure Cookies**
   - `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` ensure cookies are sent only over HTTPS.

3. **Secure Headers**
   - `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"` prevents clickjacking.
   - `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True` prevents MIME-type confusion.
   - `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` enables browser-based XSS filtering.

### Areas for Improvement
- Consider using **Content Security Policy (CSP)** for stricter control over scripts and resources.
- Rotate SSL certificates regularly.
- Enable monitoring for mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages).
